## My process

### Built with

ONLY
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

learn to use hover and these two properties transform: & transition:
```html
<h1>i used this properties in</h1>
```
```css
button{
    transition: 0.5s;
}

button:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

### Continued development

For Now No 
But Why Not!

### Useful resources

- [:hover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) - This helped me in hover. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - This is an amazing article which helped me to understand this property. I'd recommend it to anyone.
